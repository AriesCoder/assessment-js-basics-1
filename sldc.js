//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the process of defining user expectations for a new software being built or modified"
const design = "This  is the process to transform the user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation."
const inplementation = "The software implementation stage involves the transformation of the software technical data package (TDP) into one or more fabricated, integrated, and tested software configuration items that are ready for software acceptance testing."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the process of testing the interface between two software units or module. Itâ€™s focus on determining the correctness of the interface."
const maintain = "This is the modification of a software product after delivery to correct faults, to improve performance or other attributes."
